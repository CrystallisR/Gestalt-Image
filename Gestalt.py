# Gestalt-continuity principle:
'''
The Gestalt Principle of Continuity states that we are more likely to see continuous 
and smooth flowing lines rather than broken or jagged ones. This is because once our 
eyes begin to follow something, they will continue to travel in that direction until 
it encounters another item or object. For instance, an excellent example of this 
Continuity principle is a line with an arrow at the end of it.
